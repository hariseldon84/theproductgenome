# Scope of Research — The Product Genome Book

**Purpose:** Define research objectives, topics, and capture methodology for gathering evidence, case studies, and academic/practitioner insights to support the 24-chapter book structure (expanded to give each DNA dedicated depth).

**Last Updated:** 30 November 2025  
**Research Period:** Dec 2025 – Mar 2026  
**Target Completion:** 80% research before drafting begins

## Research Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Evidence-Based:** Every claim backed by research, case study, or documented experience
2. **Timeless over Trendy:** Focus on principles that transcend tools and fads
3. **Practitioner-Grounded:** Real-world validation over pure theory
4. **Multi-Disciplinary:** Draw from software engineering, product management, systems thinking, cognitive science, organizational behavior
5. **Attribution Standards:** Proper citation of sources; anonymization of case studies where required

### Research Objectives
- **Validate Framework Components:** Ensure each DNA, lens, and framework has academic/practitioner backing
- **Gather Anti-Patterns:** Document common failure modes with concrete examples
- **Collect Case Studies:** 15-20 anonymized real-world transformations (chaos → clarity)
- **Build Evidence Library:** Statistics, studies, and benchmarks for key claims
- **Identify Best Practices:** Industry patterns that align with Genome principles

- Practitioner: Engineers from recognized companies
- Avoid: Marketing content, unverified claims

### Diversity of Sources
- Multiple perspectives per topic
- Academic + practitioner balance
- Different industries represented
- Contrarian views included

### Freshness Standards
- Foundational concepts: Timeless (e.g., Brooks)
- Statistics/trends: <5 years old preferred

- Feedback loops on evidence strength
- Peer review of case study anonymization

---

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative
- [ ] 100+ academic/industry sources cited
- [ ] 15-20 anonymized case studies documented
- [ ] 50+ practitioner blog posts reviewed
- [ ] 20+ key books synthesized
- [ ] 30+ statistics/data points validated

### Qualitative
- [ ] Every major claim has backing
- [ ] Evidence diversity across sources
- [ ] Timeless principles validated
- [ ] Anti-patterns well-documented
- [ ] Case studies compelling and credible

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Insufficient academic backing for novel frameworks
**Mitigation:** Derive from established theory; document evolution from known concepts

### Risk: Case study access/permission issues
**Mitigation:** Anonymize thoroughly; focus on patterns over specifics; use public sources

### Risk: Tool-specific examples dating quickly
**Mitigation:** Frame as "principles with examples"; mark tool versions; emphasize transferability

### Risk: Information overload/scope creep
**Mitigation:** Stick to chapter-aligned research; time-box deep dives; prioritize book structure
