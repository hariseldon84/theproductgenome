**Research Date:** November 30, 2025
**Researcher:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) Theory — Clayton Christensen
- **Book**: "Competing Against Luck" (Christensen, Hall, Dillon, Duncan)
- **Core principle**: "Customers don't buy products, they **hire** them to get a job done"
- **Job definition**: "The progress a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance" — has **functional, social, and emotional dimensions**
- **Four Forces Framework** influencing product choice:
  1. **Push**: Limitations/frustrations with current solutions
  2. **Pull**: Attraction to a new product
  3. **Anxiety**: Fear of learning something new
  4. **Habit**: Comfort zone of current solution
- **Famous example**: McDonald's milkshake study — buyers needed something to satiate hunger/boredom on long commute (job: make commute less boring)
- **Implementation complexity**: Well-defined job is multilayered, requiring engineered **set of experiences** addressing many dimensions of the job

### 2. The Mom Test — Rob Fitzpatrick
- **Published 2019**, became best-selling guide to customer conversations
- **Core methodology**: Talk about their **life experiences** (not your idea) + Get **specifics from the past** (not generalizations about future)
- **The Test**: Questions structured so **even your mom can't lie** to you
- **Three simple rules**:
  1. **Avoid mentioning your idea** → automatically ask better questions
  2. **Talk about their life**, not your product
  3. **Ask about specific past experiences**, not hypothetical futures
- **Purpose**: Generate **truths instead of lies** in idea validation conversations
- **Academic validation**: Taught at Harvard, MIT, UCL; used as training manual at SkyScanner, Shopify
- **Problem solved**: Customer conversations easy to screw up, hard to do right

### 3. Continuous Discovery Habits — Teresa Torres
- **Definition**: Conducting **small research activities** through **weekly touchpoints with customers**, by the team building the product
- **Contrast**: Continuous (weekly) vs one-time research at project beginning
- **Product Trio**: Product Manager + Design Lead + Tech Lead working together from beginning, making decisions about what to build
- **Key principle**: **Outputs (features shipped) < Impact** on customer lives and business
- **Opportunity Solution Tree**: Practical framework to identify customer needs and align with business outcomes
- **Torres' reach**: Coached hundreds of teams (early-stage to global enterprises); taught 7,000+ product people through Product Talk Academy
- **Benefit**: Infuse daily product decisions with customer input (not one-off research)

### 4. Nielsen Norman Group (NN/g) — User Research Best Practices
- **Usability Testing 101** (updated Nov 15, 2024): Facilitator asks participants to perform tasks using specific interfaces
- **Recent methodologies (2024)**:
  - **Visual design testing** (Dec 13, 2024): 5-second testing, first-click testing, preference testing
  - **Unmoderated testing tools** (Dec 6, 2024): Choose tools with right features for research
  - **Research planning** (Nov 1, 2024): Document goals, methods, logistics
- **Comprehensive report**: 82 pages with **186 tips and tricks** for better usability test sessions
- **Advanced methods**: Card-sorting studies for information architecture, international usability testing
- **2024 updates**: Regular content updates throughout year maintaining cutting-edge best practices
