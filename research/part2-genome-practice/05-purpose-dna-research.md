**Research Date:** November 30, 2025
**Researcher:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Simon Sinek's "Start With Why" & The Golden Circle
- **Book published 2009**, became NYT and WSJ bestseller
- **Core principle**: "People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it"
- **Golden Circle framework** (inside-out):
  1. **Why**: Purpose and reason you exist (innermost circle)
  2. **How**: Values, principles, strategies that translate Why into action (middle circle)
  3. **What**: Tangible products/services resulting from Why + How (outermost circle)
- **Success pattern**: Successful companies and leaders **start with Why** instead of What and How
- **Theory basis**: Explains how leaders inspire cooperation, trust, and change based on research into successful organizations

### 2. OKRs (Objectives & Key Results) — John Doerr
- **"Measure What Matters" published 2018**, #1 NYT Bestseller
- **History**: Andy Grove conceived OKRs at Intel; John Doerr systematized in book; introduced to Google 1999
- **Definition**:
  - **Objectives**: Define **what** we seek to achieve (North Star direction)
  - **Key Results**: **How** those goals will be attained with specific, measurable actions in a set time frame
- **Structure**: Each Objective supported by **3-5 Key Results**
- **Google impact**: Larry Page calls OKRs "simple process that helps drive organizations forward" — "OKRs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over"
- **Focus**: Critical metrics to measure business impact (North Star Metric or set of metrics)
- **Official resource**: whatmatters.com (courses, examples, guidance)

### 3. North Star Metric — Amplitude Framework
- **Definition**: Single metric that best captures the **value customers derive** from your product
- **Purpose**: Connect "the work" to product strategy, strategy to long-term business results and customer value
- **Three essential qualities**:
  1. **Measures customer value**
  2. **Represents current product strategy**
  3. **Is a leading indicator of revenue**
- **Additional characteristics**: Expresses value, depicts vision/strategy, is actionable and understandable
- **Amplitude's example**: **Weekly Learning Users (WLUs)** — "count of active users who shared a learning that at least two other people consumed in last seven days" — drove **4x user base growth** in 2 years
- **Benefits**: Better alignment, clearer prioritization, less wasted work
- **Connection types**: Bridges customer language, product language, and business language

### 4. Hoshin Kanri (Strategy Deployment)
- **Meaning**: "Compass management" in Japanese
- **Purpose**: Lean approach for **aligning strategy with execution** across all organization levels
- **Key tool**: **X-Matrix** — visualizes how long-term goals connect to annual objectives, improvement priorities, and metrics
  - **Top**: Strategic objectives
  - **Right**: Annual objectives
  - **Left**: KPIs
  - **Bottom**: Strategic projects
- **Catchball process**: Person articulates purpose/objectives/ideas, then "throws" to stakeholders for feedback, support, action — constant two-way dialogue
- **Revolutionary aspect**: Front-line feedback mechanism for organizations accustomed to top-down strategic planning
- **Benefits**: Two-way communication and consensus-building fosters ownership and engagement

## Case Examples

### Google's OKR Transformation (1999)
- **Context**: John Doerr introduced OKRs to Google founders in 1999
- **Approach**: Objectives (what to achieve) + Key Results (how to measure)
- **Outcome**: "Helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over" (Larry Page)
- **Insight**: OKRs as "simple process that helps drive organizations forward"
- **Source**: [Medium Summary](https://wadelahring.medium.com/book-summary-measure-what-matters-by-john-doerr-8e5ab90b5b06)

### Amplitude's Weekly Learning Users (WLUs)
- **North Star definition**: "Count of active Amplitude users who shared a learning that at least two other people consumed in last seven days"
- **Rationale**: Measures **value** (learning shared), represents **strategy** (collaborative insights), **leading indicator** (engaged users → revenue)
- **Result**: 4x user base growth in 2 years
- **Source**: [North Star Playbook PDF](https://info.amplitude.com/rs/138-CDN-550/images/Amplitude-The-North-Star-Playbook.pdf)

### Intel's OKR Genesis (Andy Grove)

- **Source**: [Medium Summary](https://wadelahring.medium.com/book-summary-measure-what-matters-by-john-doerr-8e5ab90b5b06)

### Hoshin Kanri Catchball in Practice
- **Traditional approach**: Top-down strategic planning (executives decree, teams execute)
- **Hoshin Catchball**: Executives articulate purpose/objectives, "throw" to teams for feedback, teams refine and "throw back"
- **Revolutionary aspect**: Front-line feedback integrated into strategy (not just execution)
- **Outcome**: Greater ownership, engagement, realistic planning
- **Source**: [Businessmap](https://businessmap.io/lean-management/hoshin-kanri/what-is-hoshin-kanri)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Starting with What (Sinek Anti-Pattern)
- **Pattern**: Leading with products/features (What) instead of purpose (Why)
- **Example**: "We make great software" vs "We believe in empowering teams to ship without chaos"
- **Evidence**: Unsuccessful companies focus on What; successful start with Why
- **Cost**: Lack of differentiation, shallow customer connection
- **Counter**: Golden Circle — always start Why, then How, then What
- **Source**: [Simon Sinek](https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/)

### 2. OKRs as KPIs (Measurement Confusion)
- **Pattern**: Treating OKRs like traditional KPIs (status quo maintenance vs aspiration)
- **Example**: "Maintain 99% uptime" (KPI) vs "Achieve zero-downtime deployments" (OKR)
- **Evidence**: OKRs are aspirational stretch goals; KPIs are operational baselines
- **Cost**: Loss of OKR's growth-driving power
- **Counter**: OKRs focus on change/growth; KPIs track steady-state
- **Source**: [What Matters](https://www.whatmatters.com/)

### 3. Too Many OKRs (Diluted Focus)
- **Pattern**: 10+ Objectives per quarter (everything is priority = nothing is priority)
- **Evidence**: John Doerr recommends 3-5 Key Results per Objective, limited Objectives
- **Cost**: Team confusion, scattered efforts, low achievement rate
- **Counter**: Ruthless prioritization — 3-5 company Objectives max per quarter
- **Source**: [What Matters FAQs](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/how-many-okrs-to-have)

### 4. Vanity North Star (Misaligned Metric)
- **Pattern**: North Star that measures activity, not value (e.g., "Daily Active Users" for enterprise SaaS where value = outcomes delivered, not logins)
- **Evidence**: North Star must measure **customer value**, not just engagement
- **Cost**: Optimizing for wrong metric (Goodhart's Law)
- **Counter**: Amplitude's three criteria — value, strategy, revenue leading indicator
- **Source**: [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/blog/product-north-star-metric)

### 5. One-Way Hoshin (Top-Down Only)
- **Pattern**: Executives set Hoshin, declare it done (no catchball, no front-line input)
- **Evidence**: Hoshin without catchball = traditional top-down planning (not Hoshin)
- **Cost**: Lack of ownership, unrealistic plans, execution resistance
- **Counter**: Catchball process — iterate strategy with front-line feedback
- **Source**: [Businessmap](https://businessmap.io/lean-management/hoshin-kanri/what-is-hoshin-kanri)

## Purpose DNA Framework (Synthesized)

Based on research, an effective Purpose DNA includes:

### 1. Why (Simon Sinek)
- **Core belief**: What do we exist to change/improve?
- **Emotional connection**: Why should anyone care?
- **Non-negotiable**: Purpose that outlives any product/feature

### 2. Strategic Objectives (OKRs / Hoshin Kanri)
- **Objectives**: 3-5 aspirational goals (what to achieve)
- **Key Results**: Measurable outcomes (how to know we achieved it)
- **X-Matrix alignment**: Long-term goals → annual objectives → priorities → metrics

### 3. North Star Metric
- **Single metric**: Best captures customer value delivered
- **Leading indicator**: Predicts revenue/growth
- **Strategy representation**: Current product approach encoded in metric

### 4. How (Golden Circle)
- **Values**: Principles guiding decisions
- **Differentiation**: Unique approach (USP)
- **Strategy**: Path from current to desired state

### 5. What (Golden Circle)
- **Products/Features**: Tangible manifestations of Why + How
- **Outcomes**: User/business results (not just outputs shipped)

### 6. Alignment Mechanisms
- **Catchball**: Two-way dialogue (top-down + bottom-up)
- **Transparency**: Context not control (Netflix/Spotify)
- **Traceability**: Every feature → capability → objective → North Star → Why
