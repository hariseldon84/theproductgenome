## Key Findings

### 1. Don't Make Me Think — Steve Krug
- **Published 2000**, revised 2005, again 2013 (added mobile UX section)
- **Sales**: 700,000+ copies sold
- **Core premise**: Good software/web should let users accomplish tasks **as easily and directly as possible**
- **Key insight**: People are good at **satisficing** (taking first available solution) — design should leverage this
- **Three core principles**:
  1. **Intuitive navigation**: Website so intuitive users navigate without stopping to think
  2. **Clarity**: Clear communication with users
  3. **Simplifying choices**: Reduce cognitive load for easier decision-making
- **Philosophy**: Witty, commonsensical, eminently practical
- **Focus**: Usability about **people and understanding**, not technology
- **Topics covered**: Usability testing, accessibility, mobile usability, navigation design

### 2. Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics — Jakob Nielsen
- **Originally developed 1990** (Nielsen + Rolf Molich)
- **Refined 1994** via factor analysis of 249 usability problems
- **Unchanged since 1994** — language refined but heuristics remain relevant
- **The 10 Heuristics**:
  1. **Visibility of system status**: Keep users informed
  2. **Match between system and real world**: Speak users' language
  3. **User control and freedom**: Undo/redo, easy exits
  4. **Consistency and standards**: Follow platform conventions
  5. **Error prevention**: Eliminate error-prone conditions
  6. **Recognition rather than recall**: Minimize memory load
  7. **Flexibility and efficiency of use**: Accelerators for experts
  8. **Aesthetic and minimalist design**: Remove irrelevant information
  9. **Recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: Plain language error messages, suggest solutions
  10. **Help and documentation**: Searchable, focused, concrete steps
- **Purpose**: General principles identifying issues real users face with digital systems
- **Benefits**: Identify issues, enhance efficiency, increase learnability, reduce errors, improve satisfaction

### 3. Design of Everyday Things — Don Norman
- **Originally published 1988** as "The Psychology of Everyday Things"
- **Revised 2013** (expanded edition)
- **Impact**: Don Norman coined term **"user experience" (UX)** — called "Father of User Experience"
- **Key concepts**:
  - **Affordances**: Perceivable action possibilities (only actions users consider possible) — borrowed from James J. Gibson's ecological psychology
  - **Signifiers**: Communicate **where** action should take place and **how** to navigate/interact (introduced in 2013 to clarify affordance misuse)
- **Examples**:
  - **Flat plate on door** = signifier for pushing
  - **Rounded bar handle** = signifier for pulling
  - Door **affords** pushing or pulling; plate/bar **signals** which action
- **Clarification**: Many design elements are signifiers rather than affordances
- **User-centered design**: Norman defined the practice and coined the term

### 4. WCAG 2.2 Accessibility Guidelines
- **Published October 5, 2023** as W3C Recommendation
- **Latest version** of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
- **Focus**: Improving accessibility for users with **cognitive, learning, mobility disabilities** and **low vision**
- **New in 2.2**: **9 additional success criteria** since WCAG 2.1
- **Removed**: 4.1.1 Parsing (obsolete)
- **Structure**: **13 guidelines** organized under **4 principles**:
  1. **Perceivable**
  2. **Operable**
  3. **Understandable**
  4. **Robust**
- **Conformance levels**: A, AA, AAA (Level AA = globally accepted standard)
- **2024 Regulatory update**: US DOJ final rule (April 24, 2024) requires public universities meet **WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum** (ADA Title II)
- **European Accessibility Act (EAA)**: Legally applicable June 28, 2025 in EU — requires WCAG 2.1 AA for websites, apps, ebooks, ecommerce, PDFs
