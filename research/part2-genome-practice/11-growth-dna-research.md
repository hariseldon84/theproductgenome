**Status:** In Progress

## Key Findings

### 1. Growth Loops & Andrew Chen (Reforge)
- **Andrew Chen**: Works with Reforge, serves on their board
- **Growth Loops concept**: Evangelized by Brian Balfour and Andrew Chen
- **Paradigm shift**: "Growth Loops are the new funnels" — departure from traditional funnel-based models
- **Core principle**: Cyclical process where **user activity itself drives further growth** (vs linear funnels)
- **Retention connection**: "Viral growth and retention are inextricably linked...each visit is a small opportunity to prompt them to share or invite" (Andrew Chen)
- **Secret weapon**: Successful companies (Facebook, Slack, Dropbox) had **retention** as foundation
- **Product-led viral loops**: Designed into product with invite features, tagging, referral links
- **High applicability**: Product-Led Growth, gen AI app sharing flows, marketplace/ecommerce referral programs
- **Network effects**: Growth strategies involve changing product to accelerate viral growth and engagement loops reinforcing network effects
- **Focus**: More retention → more viral growth (virtuous cycle)

### 2. AARRR Pirate Metrics — Dave McClure
- **Creator**: Dave McClure, founder of 500 Startups
- **Coined**: 2007 ("Pirate Metrics" due to AARRR acronym)
- **Framework**: 5 user-behavior metrics for product-led growth businesses
- **The 5 Metrics**:
  1. **Acquisition**: Channels to introduce people to your product
  2. **Activation**: Users taking desired actions/next steps after first encounter
  3. **Retention**: Most important — shows value to users, areas to improve
  4. **Referral**: Users introducing product to friends/coworkers
  5. **Revenue**: Financial health from existing and new users
- **Purpose**: Metrics framework helping product marketers/managers define and measure customer lifecycle stages, optimize funnel for specific goals at each stage
