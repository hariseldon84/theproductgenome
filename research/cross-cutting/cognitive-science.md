## Key Findings

### 1. Dual Process Theory (Kahneman)

#### System 1 vs System 2 Thinking

- **System 1**: Fast, instinctive, emotional
  - Automatic, always active
  - Low effort, high speed
  - Prone to biases and heuristics
  - Governs most daily decisions

- **System 2**: Slower, more deliberative, logical
  - Requires conscious effort
  - High cognitive load
  - Can override System 1 (but often doesn't)
  - Used for complex analysis

- **Implications for product**: Interfaces should accommodate System 1 thinking; critical decisions should engage System 2

#### Daniel Kahneman's Legacy (2024)

- **Death**: March 27, 2024, age 90
- **Nobel Prize**: 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (with Vernon L. Smith)
- **Title**: "Grandfather of behavioral economics"
- **Core contribution**: With Amos Tversky, established cognitive basis for common human errors arising from heuristics and biases
- **Last work**: 2021 book on unwanted variability in human judgment

### 2. Major Cognitive Biases in Product Management

#### Confirmation Bias

- **Definition**: Seeking or favoring information that confirms existing beliefs
- **Product manifestations**:
  - Ignoring negative user feedback
  - Selectively interpreting data to support pre-determined decisions
  - Dismissing valid concerns from team members
- **Counter-measures**:
  - Pre-register hypotheses before experiments
  - Seek disconfirming evidence actively
  - Devil's advocate roles in decision meetings

#### Availability Heuristic

- **Definition**: Overweighting recent or memorable information
- **Product manifestations**:
  - Over-prioritizing most recent customer complaint
  - Being influenced by vivid anecdotes vs statistical data
  - Making decisions based on easily recalled examples
- **Counter-measures**:
  - Systematic data collection
  - Regular review of aggregate metrics (not just recent events)
  - Structured decision frameworks

#### Anchoring Bias

- **Definition**: Relying too heavily on first piece of information encountered
- **Product manifestations**:
  - Initial estimates become targets (even if wrong)
  - First proposed solution dominates discussion
  - Pricing anchored to initial number
- **Counter-measures**:
  - Multiple independent estimates
  - Delay judgment until full information gathered
  - Question initial assumptions explicitly

#### Sunk Cost Fallacy

- **Definition**: Continuing investment due to past costs (not future value)
- **Product manifestations**:
  - Continuing failed features because "we've already invested so much"
  - Refusing to pivot despite negative data
  - Throwing good money after bad
- **Counter-measures**:
  - Forward-looking decision criteria
  - Regular pivot evaluations
  - Separate teams for "continue/kill" decisions

#### Groupthink

- **Definition**: Team consensus overriding critical analysis
- **Product manifestations**:
  - No one questions shared assumptions
  - Dissent suppressed (social pressure)
  - Illusion of unanimity
- **Counter-measures**:
  - Designated devil's advocates
  - Anonymous feedback channels
  - Diverse team composition

### 3. Mental Models

#### Definition & Purpose

- **Mental model**: Internal representation of how systems work
- **Function**: Help understand, predict, and make decisions
- **Quality matters**: Accurate mental models → better decisions
- **Problem**: Mental models often incomplete or wrong

#### Types of Mental Models (Product Context)

1. **User mental models**: How users expect product to work
2. **Designer mental models**: How designer intends product to work
3. **System model**: How product actually works

- **Gulf of execution**: Gap between user intent and system actions
- **Gulf of evaluation**: Gap between system state and user understanding

#### Mental Model Applications

- **Design principle**: Align system model with user mental models (Don Norman)
- **Onboarding**: Build correct mental models early
- **Documentation**: Correct flawed mental models
- **Feature design**: Leverage existing mental models (metaphors)

### 4. Information Processing Limits

#### Working Memory Constraints

- **Miller's Law**: Humans can hold ~7±2 items in working memory
- **Implication**: Limit options, chunk information, reduce cognitive load
- **Product design**: Navigation hierarchies, form fields, choice architecture

#### Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)

**Three types of cognitive load:**

1. **Intrinsic Load**
   - Inherent complexity of material
   - Cannot be reduced (domain complexity is what it is)
   - Example: Understanding quantum physics vs addition

2. **Extraneous Load**
   - How information is presented
   - CAN be reduced through better design
   - Example: Poorly formatted code, cluttered UI

3. **Germane Load**
   - Effort devoted to learning and schema construction
   - SHOULD be maximized (valuable learning)
   - Example: Deliberate practice, structured tutorials

**Goal**: Minimize extraneous, optimize intrinsic + germane for available capacity

#### Attention & Focus

- **Selective attention**: Can only focus on limited information
- **Attention residue**: Switching tasks leaves cognitive residue
- **Multitasking myth**: Actually rapid task-switching with cost
- **Flow states**: Deep focus requires uninterrupted time (2+ hours)

### 5. Decision Architecture

#### Choice Architecture (Thaler & Sunstein)

- **Definition**: How choices are presented affects decisions
- **Nudges**: Small design changes that influence behavior
- **Default effects**: Default option has outsized influence
- **Product applications**:
  - Opt-in vs opt-out (consent design)
  - Smart defaults (most users never change)
  - Progressive disclosure (don't overwhelm)

#### Decision Fatigue

- **Phenomenon**: Decision quality degrades with number of decisions
- **Mechanism**: Willpower/cognitive resources deplete
- **Product implications**:
  - Reduce unnecessary decisions
  - Important decisions early in flow
  - Sensible defaults reduce decision burden

#### Framing Effects

- **Definition**: Same information, different presentation → different decisions
- **Examples**:
  - "90% success rate" vs "10% failure rate"
  - "Save $5" vs "Avoid losing $5" (loss aversion)
  - "Limited time offer" vs "Regular price later"
- **Product applications**: Messaging, pricing, feature positioning

## Anti-Patterns Observed

### 1. Ignoring Cognitive Biases

- **Pattern**: "We're logical, biases don't affect us"
- **Reality**: Everyone susceptible, awareness doesn't eliminate biases
- **Cost**: Systematic errors in judgment and decision-making
- **Counter**: Structured decision processes, pre-commitment to criteria

### 2. Overwhelming Users with Choices

- **Pattern**: More options = better (assumed)
- **Reality**: Choice overload leads to paralysis and dissatisfaction
- **Cost**: Lower conversion, decision fatigue, abandonment
- **Counter**: Curated options, smart defaults, progressive disclosure

### 3. Assuming System 2 Engagement

- **Pattern**: Designing for deliberate, careful analysis
- **Reality**: Users operate in System 1 mode most of the time
- **Cost**: Features ignored, errors made, frustration
- **Counter**: Design for fast, intuitive interaction; engage System 2 only when critical

### 4. Violating Mental Models

- **Pattern**: "Innovative" interfaces that defy conventions
- **Reality**: User mental models based on existing patterns
- **Cost**: Steep learning curve, errors, abandonment
- **Counter**: Leverage existing mental models, innovate within familiar frameworks

### 5. Excessive Cognitive Load

- **Pattern**: Dense interfaces, complex flows, unclear information architecture
- **Reality**: Working memory limits (~4-7 items)
- **Cost**: User frustration, errors, cognitive overload
- **Counter**: Chunking, hierarchy, progressive disclosure, eliminate extraneous load

## Open Questions

1. **Bias Mitigation Effectiveness**: Do structured processes actually reduce biases, or just shift them? (Meta-analysis needed)

2. **Cultural Variability**: Do cognitive biases manifest differently across cultures? (Western-centric research bias?)

3. **AI Decision Support**: Can AI tools help overcome cognitive biases, or introduce new ones? (Automation bias, algorithmic fairness)

4. **Cognitive Load Measurement**: How to quantitatively measure cognitive load in real-world products? (Proxy metrics? Eye-tracking? fMRI too expensive?)

5. **System 1/System 2 Boundary**: Where's the line? (Some evidence suggests continuum, not dichotomy)

6. **Decision Fatigue Recovery**: How quickly does decision-making capacity recover? (Sleep? Breaks? Glucose?)

7. **Individual Differences**: How much does cognitive capacity vary? (Significant implications for "average user" assumptions)
