# Chapter 3: Feature Factory vs Genome-Driven — Research

**Research Date:** November 30, 2025
**Researcher:** Mary (Business Analyst)
**Status:** In Progress

---

## Key Findings

### 1. The "Feature Factory" Concept (John Cutler)
- **Coined by John Cutler** around 2016 — observing companies focused on completing story points over learning what users wanted
- **Core anti-pattern**: Organizations measure success by **outputs rather than outcomes**
- **Feature factory definition**: Teams focused on **shipping features for the sake of shipping**, not solving real problems
- **Measurement theater**: Velocity metrics, sprint points, burndown charts used as productivity proxies (misapplied)
- **Common causes**:
  - Business being overly prescriptive
  - Pressure to utilize tech efficiently
  - Date-based commitments
  - Sunk cost bias approving only detailed plans
  - Reluctance to discover requirements
  - Ingrained IT service model habits

### 2. Marty Cagan's Perspective (Empowered Teams)
- **"Inspired" (2017)**: Best practices from top product teams
- **"Empowered" (2020)**: Leadership techniques for product teams
- **"Transformed" (2024)**: Practical advice on closing the gap — addressing criticism that prior works were idealistic/Silicon Valley-only
- **Core principle**: Empowered teams accountable to **business results (outcomes)** not **shipped features (outputs)**
- **Product operating model**:
  - Empowering cross-functional teams with **problems to solve**
  - Focusing on **outcomes over output**
  - Doing **product discovery** to minimize waste through risk assessment and rapid experiments
- **Cagan's observation**: "Teams have little understanding of the bigger context, and even less belief that these are in fact the right solutions"
- **Trust and empowerment**: Teams not truly empowered due to lack of trust; can only be held accountable if also empowered

### 3. The Build Trap (Melissa Perri)
- **"Escaping the Build Trap" (2019)**
- **Build trap definition**: "When organizations measure their success by outputs rather than outcomes! They focus on shipping features, instead of the value of these features"
- **Product-led vs other models**:
  - **Product-led**: Success driven by growth and learning
  - **Sales-led / Visionary-led / Technology-led**: Shipping features (output) is main concern
- **Product-led characteristics**: Culture organizes around **outcomes over outputs**, cadence revolves around evaluating strategies to meet outcomes
- **Outputs vs Outcomes**:
  - **Outputs**: Easily quantified things we produce (products, features, releases, development velocity)
  - **Outcomes**: Only measurable when you first understand what customers truly want or need
- **MVP redefinition**: "The minimum amount of effort to learn" — keeps teams anchored on outcomes, not outputs
- **Author credibility**: Melissa Perri appointed to Harvard Business School faculty (2019) to teach Product Management in MBA program

### 4. Outputs vs Outcomes (OKR Framework)
- **Outputs**: Direct products of work done during working hours
- **Outcomes**: Value or benefit created with the work
- **Example contrast**:
  - **Output**: Shipping a feature on time (specific task agreed upon)
  - **Outcome**: Providing value (e.g., better UX proven by reduced support tickets)
- **OKR best practices**:
  - **Key Results should be outcome-driven**, not activity to-do lists
  - Measure **outcomes (change in relevant measurement)**, not outputs (deployed features)
  - Traditional KPIs often emphasize output-based measurements; OKRs focus on outcomes
- **Bad (output-focused) example**:
  - Objective: Improve user engagement
  - Key Result 1: Launch 3 new features by Q end
  - Key Result 2: Redesign UI
  - **Problem**: Both measure what's built, not whether engagement improved
- **Good (outcome-focused) example**:
  - Tie results to **behavior change metrics**: increased daily active users, session duration
- **Where outputs fit**: One level deeper in **initiatives and activities** necessary to achieve Key Results, not in the Key Results themselves

### 5. Velocity Trap & Measurement Theater
- **Story points are "local currency"**: One point means different things to different teams
- **Velocity is NOT a productivity metric**: Using it that way conflicts with Agile principles (delivering customer value, trusting self-organizing teams)
- **Team-level metric only**: Should not be used for comparing teams or performance management
- **Risk of gaming**: Bonuses/rewards tied to velocity lead to **story point inflation** (underestimating stories for higher scores)
- **Proper uses**:
  - **Forecasting**: Trailing measure to predict future delivery
  - **Sprint planning**: Helps teams become predictable around commitments
  - **Progress tracking**: Burndown charts provide forward-looking perspective on work remaining
- **Measurement theater**: Metrics that look like progress but don't indicate value delivery

## Statistics & Data Points

### Feature Usage (Cross-reference Ch 1)
- **80% features rarely/never used** — Outputs produced without outcome validation — [Ch 1, Pendo Research]
- **6% active engagement** (Oct 2024) — Feature factory byproduct — [Ch 1, Mind the Product]

### Build Trap Indicators
- **Organizations measure success by outputs** not outcomes (Perri definition) — [Source 15]
- **"Shipping features" is main concern** in sales/visionary/technology-led models — [Source 16]

### Velocity Misuse
- **Story points = "local currency"** (team-specific, non-comparable) — [Source 28]
- **Bonuses tied to velocity → story point inflation** (gaming) — [Source 31]

## Case Examples

### Feature Factory Example: Cagan's Observation
- **Context**: Waterfall goals/metrics in agile teams
- **Symptom**: Teams "just flesh out details, code and test"
- **Root cause**: "Little understanding of bigger context, even less belief these are right solutions"
- **Source**: [SVPG](https://www.svpg.com/product-model-concepts/), [Cutler](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-2652-scaled-feature-factories)

### Empowerment Failure: Trust Gap
- **Pattern**: Teams not truly empowered due to lack of trust
- **Contradiction**: Can only be accountable if also empowered (circular trap)
- **Solution**: Build psychological safety, empower with problems (not solutions)
- **Source**: [Mind the Product](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/empowered-product-teams-by-marty-cagan/)

### MVP Misapplication: Output Focus
- **Anti-pattern**: MVP as "launch anything" (output)
- **Correct interpretation**: "Minimum amount of effort to learn" (outcome)
- **Impact**: Anchors on learning/validation vs shipping
- **Source**: [Dragonboat](https://dragonboat.io/blog/escaping-the-build-trap/)

### OKR Failure: Output-Dressed-As-Outcome
- **Bad Key Results**:
  - "Launch 3 new features by Q end"
  - "Redesign user interface"
- **Why bad**: Both describe *what's built*, not *whether engagement improved*
- **Better Key Results**:
  - "Increase daily active users by 20%"
  - "Increase session duration from 8min to 12min"

## Anti-Patterns Observed

### 1. Output Obsession
- **Pattern**: Measuring success by features shipped, story points completed, velocity trends
- **Evidence**: 80% features unused (Ch 1), feature factory prevalence (Cutler)
- **Cost**: Wasted capacity, technical debt, user dissatisfaction
- **Counter**: OKRs focused on behavior change, outcome metrics (DAU, retention, NPS)

### 2. Velocity as Productivity Proxy
- **Pattern**: Treating story points as team performance indicator, comparing teams, tying rewards to velocity
- **Evidence**: "Local currency" (team-specific), gaming via inflation
- **Cost**: Measurement theater, misaligned incentives, trust erosion
- **Counter**: Use velocity only for forecasting/planning (trailing measure)

### 3. Fake Empowerment
- **Pattern**: Claiming teams are empowered while prescribing solutions, micromanaging, withholding context
- **Evidence**: Cagan's "little understanding of bigger context" observation
- **Cost**: Disengagement, lack of innovation, accountability without authority
- **Counter**: Empower with problems (not solutions), provide strategic context, build trust

### 4. MVP Misinterpretation
- **Pattern**: "MVP" as excuse to ship broken/incomplete products (output focus)
- **Evidence**: Perri's "launch for sake of launching" critique
- **Cost**: User frustration, brand damage, rework
- **Counter**: MVP = "minimum effort to learn" (outcome: validated learning)

### 5. Build Trap (Systemic)
- **Pattern**: Sales/technology/visionary-led models where "shipping features" is primary goal
- **Evidence**: Product-led success = growth + learning (opposite approach)
- **Cost**: Feature bloat, low engagement (6% active use), competitive disadvantage
- **Counter**: Product-led culture organizing around outcomes, strategy evaluation cadence

## Open Questions

1. **Causality**: Does feature factory *cause* low engagement (6%), or does low engagement pressure teams to ship more features (vicious cycle)?

2. **Recovery Time**: How long does it take a feature factory to transform to outcome-oriented? (Months? Years? Cagan's "Transformed" addresses this)

3. **Incentive Structures**: What reward systems reinforce outcomes over outputs? (Beyond "don't tie bonuses to velocity")

4. **Measurement Alternatives**: If velocity is "measurement theater," what *should* teams measure? (Outcome metrics, yes, but which?)

5. **Empowerment Threshold**: What's the minimum context/authority required for true empowerment? (Cagan: "problems to solve" — but how defined?)

6. **Build Trap Escape Velocity**: What early indicators show a team is escaping the build trap? (Feature usage %, retention curves, time to validated learning?)

2. ✅ Outputs vs outcomes framework synthesized (OKRs)
3. ✅ Velocity trap / measurement theater documented
4. ⏭️ **MQB research** (Chapter 4): Quality gates, DoD, TDD impact
5. ⏭️ **Case study collection**: Find 2-3 anonymized examples of feature factory → outcome-oriented transformations
6. ⏭️ **Deeper OKR literature**: John Doerr's "Measure What Matters" (complement Cagan/Perri)
7. ⏭️ **Product-led growth**: Expanded research on product-led vs sales-led models
