# 20-Chapter Structure Mapping

Purpose: Define a clear, executable structure for a 90,000+ word book (5 Parts × 4 Chapters) aligned to the Product Genome layers and frameworks.

> Navigation: [Layer 1: 8 DNAs](./layer1_dna.md) · [Layer 2: Evolution Flow](./layer2_dna.md) · [Layer 3: Builder's Lenses](./layer3_dna.md) · [Layer 4: Extended Frameworks](./layer4_frameworks.md) · [Session Overview](./00-session-overview.md)

## Word Count Strategy
- Target length: 90,000–110,000 words
- Parts: 5 (each ~18,000–22,000 words)
- Chapters per Part: 4 (each ~4,500–5,500 words)
- Buffer: ±10% per chapter to accommodate examples/case studies
- Distribution rule: Heavier chapters (foundational philosophy, DNAs) receive upper bound; narrative/case chapters lean mid-range

## Voice & Style
- First-person, reflective practitioner voice
- Timeless principles; dated examples only when instructive
- HOTS framing: always connect concept → daily practice → artifact → gate
- Build from chaos → clarity narrative arc across Parts

## Part Overview (5 Parts)
1. Foundations & Philosophy (Ch. 1–4)
2. The Genome in Practice (Ch. 5–8)
3. Evolution Flow & Lenses (Ch. 9–12)
4. Extended Frameworks & AI Co-Creation (Ch. 13–16)
5. Operating System: Governance, Case Studies, and Execution (Ch. 17–20)

   - Artifact refs: Layer3 Psychological/Constraint
12. Evolution Lens — Learning as Operating Principle (4,500–5,000)

   - Artifact refs: Layer3 Evolution

### Part IV — Extended Frameworks & AI Co-Creation

15. Product Gravity & Bio-Agile Adaptation (4,500–5,000)
   - Attraction fields; adaptive cadence
   - Artifact refs: Layer4 Gravity/Bio-Agile
16. NCO + APAP — Governed Human–AI Assembly (5,000–6,000)
   - NCO governance; APAP stages; templates; QA gates
   - Artifact refs: Layer4 NCO/APAP + `templates/apap/*`

### Part V — Operating System: Governance & Execution
17. Governance by Artifacts (4,500–5,000)
   - ADRs, MQB, contracts, instrumentation, validation ladders
   - Outcome: Documentation as operating system
18. Case Studies — Before/After Genome (5,000–6,000)
   - 2–3 anonymized cases mapping chaos→clarity
   - Outcome: Proof via practice
19. Playbooks — From Idea to Release (4,500–5,500)
   - Step-by-step workflows; gates; checklists; templates usage
   - Outcome: Repeatable execution
20. Scaling & Culture — Sustaining Integrity (4,500–5,500)
   - Cohorts, loops, unit economics, cultural antibodies
   - Outcome: Sustainable growth without erosion

## Per-Chapter Structure Template
- Opening: problem/context + promise (150–250 words)
- Principle: core idea distilled (600–800)
- Practice: artifacts, workflows, gates (2,000–2,500)
- Examples: short cases or vignettes (1,000–1,500)
- Anti-Patterns & Corrections (400–600)
- Summary & Next Steps (200–300)

## Evidence & Validation Plan
- Each chapter includes:
  - Evidence standards relevant to scope
  - Traceability tags: `TRACE:part:chapter:section`
  - Suggested exercises and checks
  - Cross-links to Layer docs and APAP templates when applicable

## Pacing & Cohesion Rules
- Alternate heavier concept chapters with practice-heavy chapters
- Maintain recurring anchors: MQB, ADR, JTBD, gates, traceability
- Keep examples anonymized but concrete; avoid tool fanfare
- Reiterate genome flow where relevant: Purpose→User→Experience→Feature

## Editing & Revision Strategy
- Pass 1: Structural coherence and arc integrity
- Pass 2: Artifact accuracy and cross-link checks
- Pass 3: Tighten voice; remove repetition; clarify examples
- Final: Word count balancing, figure/table placement

## Figures & Tables (Recurring)
- Chaos vs Genome comparison matrix
- MQB charter example
- Evolution Flow artifacts per stage table
- Lenses decision matrix
- APAP stage→template map

## Cross-Link Index
- Layer 1 DNAs: `./layer1_dna.md`
- Layer 2 Evolution Flow: `./layer2_dna.md`
- Layer 3 Lenses: `./layer3_dna.md`
- Layer 4 Frameworks: `./layer4_frameworks.md`
- APAP Templates: `./templates/apap/`

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Over-length in foundational chapters → Mitigation: strict template adherence
- Risk: Tool-centric drift → Mitigation: principle-first examples
- Risk: Scope creep in case studies → Mitigation: 2–3 cases max with fixed structure

## Appendix: Word Count Tracker
- Maintain a spreadsheet or markdown table updated per chapter with actuals vs targets
- Include notes for planned rebalancing after each editing pass
