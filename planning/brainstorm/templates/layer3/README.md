# Layer 3 Templates: Five Builder’s Lenses

Purpose: Provide lens-specific templates to apply Systems, Psychological, Architectural, Evolution, and Constraint perspectives to decisions.

Lenses:
- 01 Systems Lens — holistic system thinking, dependencies, flows
- 02 Psychological Lens — cognitive load, legibility, user perception
- 03 Architectural Lens — boundaries, contracts, observability
- 04 Evolution Lens — learning loops, validation integration
- 05 Constraint Lens — guardrails, trade-offs, safety

Traceability: Use `TRACE:L3:<Lens>:<Section>`.
