# Template: Evolution Lens

Purpose: Embed learning loops and validation into the design and execution.

## Inputs
- Validation experiment pack
- Test design plan

## Checks
- Assumptions → experiments mapping
- Fast feedback: can we observe outcomes quickly?
- Pivot triggers: thresholds defined and actionable

## Outputs (Artifacts)
- Experiment Map: requirement → experiment → evidence
- Feedback Plan: signals, cadence, ownership
- Pivot Rules: documented thresholds and actions

## Anti-Patterns
- Build-first validate-later
- Vanity metrics; lack of disconfirming evidence

## Traceability
- `TRACE:L3:Evolution:<section>`

## Ready-to-Use Prompt
```
Goal: Apply Evolution Lens to <initiative>
Inputs: experiments, test plan
Output: experiment map + feedback plan + pivot rules
