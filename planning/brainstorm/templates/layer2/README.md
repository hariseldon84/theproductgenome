# Layer 2 Templates: Evolution Flow Cycle

Purpose: Provide stage-by-stage templates to operationalize Vision → Decomposition → Design → Build → Validate → Evolve with clear inputs, artifacts, gates, and prompts.

Stages:
- 01 Vision Stage — clarify outcomes, constraints, and stakes
- 02 Decomposition Stage — break vision into components and work packets
- 03 Design Stage — specify interfaces, flows, and MQB alignment
- 04 Build Stage — implement with boundaries, contracts, and observability
- 05 Validate Stage — convert assumptions to evidence, run gates
- 06 Evolve Stage — learn, refactor, and plan next iteration

Traceability: Use `TRACE:L2:<Stage>:<Section>` within each artifact.
