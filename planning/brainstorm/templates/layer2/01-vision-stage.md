# Template: Vision Stage

Purpose: Establish clear outcomes, constraints, and narrative for the iteration.

## Inputs
- Purpose outcomes (from Layer 1)
- Constraints: time, budget, compliance
- Stakes & success definition

## Outputs (Artifacts)
- Vision Brief (1 pager): outcome, scope boundaries, non-goals
- Success Metrics: measurable outcome targets
- Risk Register (initial): top risks + mitigations

## Process
- Define outcome in one sentence (no features)
- Bound scope and list explicit non-goals
- Set success metrics and constraints

## Stage Gate
- PASS: Outcome defined, constraints clear, metrics set
- CONCERNS: Ambiguous scope or missing metrics
- FAIL: Feature-led vision or no constraints

## Anti-Patterns
- Tool-first narrative
- Vague “improve experience” goals
- Unbounded scope

## Traceability
- `TRACE:L2:Vision:<section>`

## Ready-to-Use Prompt
```
Goal: Draft Vision Brief for <initiative>
Inputs: outcomes, constraints, metrics
Output: 1-page brief + risk register + non-goals
```
