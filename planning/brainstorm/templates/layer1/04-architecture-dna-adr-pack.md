# Template: Architecture DNA ADR Pack

Purpose: Document principled structural decisions and constraints.

## ADR Template
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences
- Alternatives rejected

## System Context Diagram
- Boundaries, external systems, data flows:

## Module/Service Map
- Components, responsibilities, dependencies, contracts:

## Technology Constraints Register
- Approved/forbidden patterns + rationale:

## NFR Specifications
- Performance, security, reliability, scalability thresholds:

## Traceability
- `TRACE:L1:Architecture:<section>`

## Ready-to-Use Prompt
```
Goal: Draft ADR pack
Inputs: current architecture, constraints, NFRs
Output: ADRs + diagrams + NFR specs
