# Template: User DNA JTBD Pack

Purpose: Ground user understanding in behavior, JTBD, triggers, and value signals.

## Behavior Archetypes
- 3–5 archetypes (goals, pains, triggers):

## JTBD Cards
- Situation → Motivation → Desired Outcome (+ Constraints):

## Usage Narratives
- 3–7 step flows (intent → action → outcome → feedback):

## Value Signals Map
- Observable signals equated with quality/trust:

## Validation Targets
- Outcomes to measure in experiments:

## Traceability
- `TRACE:L1:User:<section>`

## Ready-to-Use Prompt
```
Goal: Create User DNA JTBD pack
Inputs: behavior research, interviews, usage data
