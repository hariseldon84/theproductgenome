# Template: Growth DNA Model Kit

Purpose: Design sustainable growth mechanisms and guardrails.

## Growth Model
- Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue → Referral:

## Conversion Funnels
- Drop-off analysis + hypotheses:

## Cohort Retention Curves
- Value compounding patterns:

## Unit Economics
- CAC, LTV, payback, margin:

## Growth Loops Map
- Natural vs manufactured loops:

## Capacity Planning
- System/support scaling thresholds:

## Growth Guardrails
- Metrics that slow/pause growth:

## Traceability
- `TRACE:L1:Growth:<section>`

## Ready-to-Use Prompt
```
Goal: Create growth model kit
Inputs: user cohorts, economics, telemetry
Output: models, loops, guardrails, capacity plan
```
