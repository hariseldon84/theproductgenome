## Data Schema & Ontology
- Entities, events, relationships, definitions:

## Pipeline Architecture
- Collection, transformation, storage, access:

## Privacy & Compliance Register

## Instrumentation Standards
- Event naming, payload structure, metadata:

## Insight Playbooks
- How patterns trigger action:

## Traceability
- `TRACE:L1:Data:<section>`

## Ready-to-Use Prompt
```
Goal: Create instrumentation plan
Inputs: product outcomes, architecture
Output: schema, pipelines, standards, playbooks
