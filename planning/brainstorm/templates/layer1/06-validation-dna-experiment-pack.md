# Template: Validation DNA Experiment Pack

Purpose: Convert assumptions into evidence via rigorous experiments.

## Assumption Map
- Prioritized by risk:

## Experiments
- Hypothesis → Test Design → Success Criteria → Results:

## Learning Log
- Belief → Test → Learning → Change:

## Validation Ladder
- Concept → usability → viability → scalability:

## Evidence Standards
- What counts as validated per stage:

## Pivot Triggers
- Thresholds forcing reassessment:

## Traceability
- `TRACE:L1:Validation:<section>`

## Ready-to-Use Prompt
```
Goal: Build experiment pack
Inputs: riskiest assumptions, user/data signals
Output: experiments, standards, triggers
