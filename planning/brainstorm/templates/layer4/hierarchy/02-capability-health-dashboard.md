## Capability Inventory

| Capability ID | Capability Name | Domain | Purpose Link | Current Health | Trend |
|---------------|-----------------|--------|--------------|----------------|-------|
| CAP-001 | [Capability] | [Domain/Service] | [Purpose statement] | 🟢 Healthy / 🟡 At Risk / 🔴 Failing | ↗️ Improving / → Stable / ↘️ Declining |
| CAP-002 | | | | | |

---

## Health Criteria

**🟢 Healthy:**
- All features implementing the capability are aligned with outcomes
- Telemetry validates outcome achievement
- Technical quality meets standards (test coverage, performance, maintainability)
- No significant technical debt or architectural violations

**🟡 At Risk:**
- Some features have weak outcome links
- Partial telemetry coverage or mixed validation results
- Technical debt accumulating but manageable
- Minor architectural concerns

**🔴 Failing:**
- Orphaned features or unclear outcome mapping
- No telemetry or failing validation
- Critical technical debt or architectural violations
- Capability bloat without outcome uplift
