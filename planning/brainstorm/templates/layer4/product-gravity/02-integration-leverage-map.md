# Integration Leverage Map

**Project:** [Project Name]  
**Version:** [X.Y]  
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

---

## Purpose

Identify which integrations provide the highest return on retention, user value, and ecosystem growth. Prioritize integration investments based on leverage.

---

## Integration Leverage Formula

**Leverage Score = (Retention Uplift × User Reach × Strategic Value) / Implementation Effort**

- **Retention Uplift:** % increase in retention for users with this integration active
- **User Reach:** % of user base that would benefit
- **Strategic Value:** 1-10 score for ecosystem/competitive importance
- **Implementation Effort:** 1-10 score (10 = massive effort)

## Active Integrations

| Integration | Category | Users Using | Retention Uplift | User Reach | Strategic Value | Effort | Leverage Score | Status |
|-------------|----------|-------------|------------------|------------|-----------------|--------|----------------|--------|
| [Name] | [Tool/Platform] | [#] ([%]) | +[X]% | [%] | [1-10] | [1-10] | [Score] | 🟢 Healthy / 🟡 At Risk / 🔴 Underperforming |
