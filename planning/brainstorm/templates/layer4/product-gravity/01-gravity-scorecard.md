# Gravity Scorecard

**Project:** [Project Name]  
**Assessment Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Review Period:** [Date range]  
**Assessed By:** [Team/Role]

---

## Purpose

Measure the "gravitational pull" of the product—the accumulating mass that retains users and attracts ecosystem integrations.

---

## Gravity Formula

**Product Gravity = Outcome Delivery × Trust × Habit Formation × Integration Depth × Narrative Coherence**

Each component scored 0-100; overall gravity is the geometric mean (not sum) to prevent weak areas from being masked.

## Overall Gravity Score

**Calculation Method:** Geometric mean to ensure balance

```
Gravity = ⁵√(Outcome × Trust × Habit × Integration × Narrative)
        = ⁵√([X] × [Y] × [Z] × [A] × [B])
        = [Score/100]
```

**Overall Score:** [X/100]

**Rating:**
- 🟢 Strong Gravity (≥75): High retention, growing ecosystem
- 🟡 Moderate Gravity (50-74): Some pull, but gaps exist
- 🔴 Weak Gravity (≤49): Retention risk, ecosystem underdeveloped

**Trend (3-month comparison):**

| Period | Outcome | Trust | Habit | Integration | Narrative | Overall |
|--------|---------|-------|-------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| 3 mo ago | [X] | [Y] | [Z] | [A] | [B] | [Score] |
| 2 mo ago | [X] | [Y] | [Z] | [A] | [B] | [Score] |
| 1 mo ago | [X] | [Y] | [Z] | [A] | [B] | [Score] |
| Current | [X] | [Y] | [Z] | [A] | [B] | [Score] |
