# Fitness Gradient Map

**Project:** [Project Name]  
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Review Period:** [Timeframe]  
**Facilitated By:** [Team/Role]

---

## Purpose

Map the evolutionary "fitness landscape" for your product, identifying directions of opportunity (fitness peaks) and risks (fitness valleys), guiding adaptive strategy using biological evolution metaphors.

---

## Fitness Landscape Concept

**Biological Metaphor:** Species evolve by climbing fitness peaks (better adaptations to environment). The landscape has:
- **Peaks:** High fitness (well-adapted)
- **Valleys:** Low fitness (poorly adapted)
- **Ridges:** Multiple viable paths
- **Plateaus:** Local optima (good enough, but not global best)

**Product Translation:** Product features/strategies have varying fitness in the market environment. Evolution requires navigating this landscape toward higher fitness.

## Adaptive Strategies

### 1. Hill Climbing (Incremental Optimization)

**When to Use:** Already near a fitness peak, small improvements available

**Strategy:** Iterate on current direction, A/B test, optimize

**Directions Suited:**
- [Direction X] — Why: [Rationale]

---

### 2. Plateau Escape (Disruptive Jump)

**When to Use:** Stuck on local optimum, need to explore new space

**Strategy:** Experiment with novel approaches, pivot, take calculated risks

**Directions Suited:**
- [Direction Y] — Why: [Rationale]

---

### 3. Ridge Walking (Multiple Viable Paths)

**When to Use:** Multiple good directions available, can pursue in parallel

**Strategy:** Portfolio approach, diversify bets

**Directions Suited:**
- [Direction Z] — Why: [Rationale]

---

### 4. Valley Crossing (Short-term pain for long-term gain)

**When to Use:** Need to descend temporarily to reach higher peak

**Strategy:** Invest in infrastructure, replatform, rebuild

**Directions Suited:**
- [Direction W] — Why: [Rationale]
