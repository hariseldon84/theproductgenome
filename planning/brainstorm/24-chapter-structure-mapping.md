# 24-Chapter Structure Mapping

Purpose: Define a clear, executable structure for a 110,000+ word book aligned to the Product Genome layers and frameworks, with each DNA receiving dedicated chapter treatment.

> Navigation: [Layer 1: 8 DNAs](./layer1_dna.md) · [Layer 2: Evolution Flow](./layer2_dna.md) · [Layer 3: Builder's Lenses](./layer3_dna.md) · [Layer 4: Extended Frameworks](./layer4_frameworks.md) · [Session Overview](./00-session-overview.md)

## Word Count Strategy
- Target length: 110,000–132,000 words (expanded from original 90k to give each DNA dedicated depth)
- Parts: 5 (varying chapter counts based on content depth)
- Chapters: 24 total (expanded from 20 to split composite DNAs into individual chapters)
- Per Chapter: 4,500–6,000 words
- Buffer: ±10% per chapter to accommodate examples/case studies
- Distribution rule: DNA chapters (Part II) receive upper bound (5,500–6,000 words); narrative/case chapters lean mid-range

## Voice & Style
- First-person, reflective practitioner voice
- Timeless principles; dated examples only when instructive
- HOTS framing: always connect concept → daily practice → artifact → gate
- Build from chaos → clarity narrative arc across Parts

## Part Overview (5 Parts)
1. Foundations & Philosophy (Ch. 1–4) — 4 chapters
2. The Genome in Practice: The 8 DNAs (Ch. 5–12) — 8 chapters

## Per-Chapter Structure Template
- Opening: problem/context + promise (150–250 words)
- Principle: core idea distilled (600–800)
- Practice: artifacts, workflows, gates (2,000–2,500)
- Examples: short cases or vignettes (1,000–1,500)
- Anti-Patterns & Corrections (400–600)
- Summary & Next Steps (200–300)

## Evidence & Validation Plan
- Each chapter includes:
  - Evidence standards relevant to scope
  - Traceability tags: `TRACE:part:chapter:section`
  - Suggested exercises and checks
  - Cross-links to Layer docs and APAP templates when applicable

## Pacing & Cohesion Rules
- Alternate heavier concept chapters with practice-heavy chapters
- Maintain recurring anchors: MQB, ADR, JTBD, gates, traceability
- Keep examples anonymized but concrete; avoid tool fanfare
- Reiterate genome flow where relevant: Purpose→User→Experience→Feature

## Editing & Revision Strategy
- Pass 1: Structural coherence and arc integrity
- Pass 2: Artifact accuracy and cross-link checks
- Pass 3: Tighten voice; remove repetition; clarify examples
- Final: Word count balancing, figure/table placement

## Figures & Tables (Recurring)
- Chaos vs Genome comparison matrix
- MQB charter example
- Evolution Flow artifacts per stage table
- Lenses decision matrix
- APAP stage→template map

## Cross-Link Index
- Layer 1 DNAs: `./layer1_dna.md`
- Layer 2 Evolution Flow: `./layer2_dna.md`
- Layer 3 Lenses: `./layer3_dna.md`
- Layer 4 Frameworks: `./layer4_frameworks.md`
- APAP Templates: `./templates/apap/`

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Over-length in foundational chapters → Mitigation: strict template adherence
- Risk: Tool-centric drift → Mitigation: principle-first examples
- Risk: Scope creep in case studies → Mitigation: 2–3 cases max with fixed structure

## Appendix: Word Count Tracker
- Maintain a spreadsheet or markdown table updated per chapter with actuals vs targets
- Include notes for planned rebalancing after each editing pass
