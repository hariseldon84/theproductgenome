# The Enemy - The Seven Faces of Chaos

## Identified Chaos Manifestations

### 1. "Move Fast and Break Things" Delusion
- Speed worship without strategic foundation
- Breaking things becomes normalized, not exceptional

### 2. The Broken MVP Myth
- MVP misunderstood as "launch anything"
- Launching for the sake of launching
- Missing the "minimum" in quality and experience that users actually need
- Confusing "viable" with "barely functional"

### 3. Hype-Driven Technology Selection
- Fascination with latest trends (Web3, AI, newest frameworks)
- Technology choices driven by FOMO, not product needs
- "We must use X because everyone is talking about it"
- Tool selection before problem definition
